Sometime in the middle of 2023, YouTube's algorithm started to recommend me some mountaineering videos, from channels like
[Alta Montanha](https://www.youtube.com/@AltaMontanha) and [Gente de Montanha](https://www.youtube.com/c/GentedeMontanha).

I quickly became very interested in the subject and binge watched dozens of hours of mountain related content, discovering some of the coolest mountains of the world and seeing people climbing them. 

Impulsively, I decided that I wanted to climb a high altitude mountain. Then, I started looking for companies that would help me do it and after some price and review comparisons I chose Gente de Montanha ("Mountain People"). They are led by the great Maximo Kausch, renowned Argentinean climber with over two decades of experience, world record holder for the most 6000m mountains climbed, mountain guide and more.

On the personal side, he's also a great guy. I had absolutely zero previous experience with mountains, camping or hiking, and he patiently explained to me the ins and outs of the expedition, the exact equipment I should bring, how I should train and prepare, what to buy, what to hire and what should my expectations be. He was very clear with me that if I wanted to go to Aconcágua with zero experience, the odds of making it to the top were slim. In fact, he mentioned he only knew 3 people that had ever done that.

Aconcágua is not a technical mountain. That is, you can reach the top without special climbing equipment, you don't need to climb vertical ice walls, you don't have to worry about crossing crevasses, you don't have very steep sections, you can get to the top by walking with your trekking poles and double boots.

With that in mind, I thought it would be easy. Just walk, right? Boy, I was wrong.

The mountain is difficult. To give some perspective, I'm a male in my mid twenties, fit, in great health condition, have been going to the gym regularly for about a year, do about 45 minutes to one hour of cardio activity daily and weigh 74kg at 181cm tall. Yet, the Aconcágua expedition was the hardest physical effort of my life and I came very close to giving up several times. So, let's get into it.

# Mendoza

The expedition starts in Mendoza, Argentina. The city is about one thousand kilometers west of the capital Buenos Aires and is known for its wineries, as well as its nearby high altitude mountains. We stayed at a hotel and had the chance to walk around a couple of blocks and get a feel for the place. Really comfy town, definitely want to go back there to explore more stuff.

In Mendoza, we had the guides go through all of our equipment and check if there's anything missing. Since it was my first mountain, I had to hire most of the equipment, including: a heavy feather jacket for the summit day, La Sportiva double boots, one trekking pole (I bought only one, thinking it would be enough), mittens, thick socks, crampons, a sleeping bag, a mattress and more. It all came down to $915 worth of hired equipment. I had only brought $1,000 to this trip so I was broke at that point.

After getting all the equipment checked, the guides instructed us to separate our stuff into three bags: our backpack, the essentials which would be with us at all times; our Confluência camp bag, which included things like extra clothes, toothpaste, toothbrush and other hygiene essentials, and lastly our Plaza de Mulas bag, which contained high camp stuff like crampons, mittens and double boots.

Both the second and third bags would be carried by mules to the respective camps and meet us there, while the first bag would be carried by us since the start.

# Night in Los Penitentes

From the hotel in Mendoza, we got into a van and headed west towards the park entrance. But we stayed one night at a little hotel in Los Penitentes, at 2500m where we did some acclimatization and medical checks. Super comfortable place in the middle of nowhere, it just was a taste of the cold and altitude that we were going to face.

# Park Entrance

We left the hotel at 10am the next day and headed to the Acocágua Provincial Park. After a couple of hours on the road with some amazing mountain sights — almost any time you looked outside through the window, you could see huge, beautiful mountains, and I wondered if anyone had climbed it — we arrived at the park entrance. The beginning of the journey.

Here we took out our immediate equipment from the van, the first bag, we got out trekking poles out, put on sunscreen, protective bandanas, sunglasses and headed to Confluência, the first camp on our way to the top of the Americas. It was a three hour walk which was actually pretty easy and a light warmup.

# Confluência

We arrived at Confluência later that day, our first camp, at 3400m. Crazy to think that it was already higher than anywhere in Brazil. There, I realized something obvious in hindsight, but not only our team was around, there were several teams from other companies and each of them had their domes, bathrooms and tent setup. The structure provided for my team was from Inka Expeditions.

I felt pretty good there, we had big domes where we could get inside, eat, chill and have a good time. The bathrooms were good, with actual toilets and stalls, which surprised me. They gave us internet access, a WiFi with 150 MB for free. I connected there and unfortunately someone had invited me to a WhatsApp group and flooded it with pictures, they were automatically downloaded and my connection was gone in literal seconds. Well, there went my internet. I could buy more but it was $80 for 1 GB, I am not that well off.

There was a bar dome where $5 coffee and beers were sold and you could chill there, charge your phone and chat.

There were tents around, but we slept in a dome with four bunk beds inside, actual beds at that altitude were a pleasant surprise. It was my first time using a sleeping bag, it not so comfortable but I got used to it after a while. Had a minor headache there, which is normal and it went away sprinkling some drops of dipyrone on my tongue.

# Visiting the South Face

Next morning we set out to some acclimatization hike and we visited the South Face of the Aconcágua at 4150m. It was a fun hike with some great views along the way, we walked with basically no weight except for some food and three liters of water, so that helped. It took us about 7 hours round trip. Considerably more effort than the initial hike from the park entrance to Confluência, but still fine. This helped our body get used to the altitude, we work high and sleep low and that makes our body produce more hemoglobin to deal with the thin, rarefied air.

One of our team members gave up here and decided to end the expedition the next day.

# Hike to Plaza de Mulas

Here is where things got serious. We woke up, had breakfast, set out our stuff for the mules and packed our backpacks with water and food. At 10am, we left on our voyage to Plaza de Mulas, also known as Aconcágua's base camp.

This is a 17km hike through a rocky, sandy, earthy, unstable gravel filled terrain, crossing a river multiple times, going up and downhill frequently, on a stroll that lasts about 8 hours on a decent pace. I can't stress enough how bad the terrain is for the majority of this trek. At times you must balance yourself on rocky river coasts to pass a section. You are surrounded by a valley of breathtaking mountains the entire time, but you can't really appreciate them unless you stop and look around, you gotta keep your eyes on the trail. You only really stop two or three times near some big rocks to hidrate yourself and eat something. By the way, the rocks are interesting when you think about them. Imagine a 10m³ rock on the middle of a valley between two mountains, it fell from either of those mountains and it rolled down to the trail with is like 300m away from either side. Must be insane to witness them violently falling and rolling down, I wonder if anyone's ever been hit.

The most brutal part of this trail is the very end. Most of the steep ascent is done near Plaza de Mulas, when you are already tired from a 7h walk. It is a tough ascent and I had to stop and gather my energy several times. Until this part, I was on a quite good pace (maybe like the 7th on a line of 15), but because I had to stop so many times, a bunch of people passed me. I ended up reaching the camp accompanied by the guide and another slower person, after most hikers had arrived.

# Plaza de Mulas

Arriving in the base camp, 4300m high, I noticed it was much larger, with way more tents and domes than Confluência. That was unexpected, I believed the further you go, the less people and structure, and that is true, but base camp is an exception. 

Plaza de Mulas had everything Confluência had, but more. There were multiple dome coffee shops, more internet providers, it had a large, luxurious deactivated hotel about 500m away. It even has the world's highest art museum. We were given more internet data here, but we had to remember our WiFi credentials from the first camp, which I didn't, so no luck for me.

There I had to sleep in an actual tent for the first time, sharing it with an Australian friend. When you are tired your standards drop significantly, so that tent was surprisingly comfortable. 

During the night there are a lot of strong winds which make noise all the time inside the tent, I could not sleep too well and was so exhausted that I wanted to give up the next morning. However, the morning came and I decided to keep going. It was rest day after all, why give up and turn back on a rest day? I chilled around, visited the old hotel, took some pictures and tried to sleep better during the night.

Also, it was New Years Eve. To celebrate, the guys managed to bring high quality Argentinean meat to base camp and we had a nice barbecue and champagne around a bonfire. It was pretty, except the cold was getting intense so I headed to my tent earlier than I would've liked. 

# Hike to Canada

After Plaza de Mulas comes camp Canada at 5000m. I slept slightly better and decided to go, because giving up is for losers. We packed our stuff and headed to Canada at 11am. But here's the tough part, from here onwards we had to either carry all our stuff or hire porters, because mules refuse to go up there, both because it's too high and because the terrain is unsuited for them. Therefore you either pay porters $450 per 10kg so they bring your stuff to the high camps, or you carry it yourself.

I was broke, so of course I had to carry it myself, about 16kg. And to be honest, it wasn't really a big deal. When you start a hike with heavy weight, you just go really slowly and go step by step, at some point you forget you are carrying a lot of weight.

Almost the entire trail to Canada is visible from base camp and it looks steeper than it is, it looks scary even. But when you're there, actually going up the trail, it's not so bad. The trail took 3 to 4 hours and while difficult, it felt easier than coming to base camp.

# Camp Canada

From Canada onwards, forget any kind of structure, internet or big domes with coffee shops, music and beer. The Canada camp had a very nice view, some tents to sleep in, a tent to defecate in and that was about it. Not much to say about it and even less to say about higher camps. At this altitude, simple things like crouching down to enter your tent or grab something on the floor become really tiresome actions. Walk a couple of steps up a small hill and you're out of breath.

Because there are no domes to prepare food here, our guides bring gas tanks to heat frozen water and prepare food, really huge thanks to them because at no point in the entire expedition we had a shortage of food or water. The logistics necessary to bring and cook fresh food to this altitude is unbelievable.

# Nido de Cóndores

To reach the next camp, Nido de Cóndores, another 5 hours of fully packed ascent is required. A tough hike, but after so much walking in the previous days we are already a bit numb in regards to the effort these things take, so to me it felt like just another day. 

We reached Nido de Cóndores, our last camp, at about 3pm. At 5500m, things here are not very comfortable. The winds are relentless, they often throw you off balance when you're walking. Again, there's not much here at this altitude. Breathing is even harder. The sight is incredible. It's ice cold at night. Actually it's ice cold whenever the sun isn't directly hitting. Luckily, the sun sets at 9pm and rises at 7am.

Here we made our plans to not go up to camp Colera (6000m), because weather forecast said the winds were too strong and it was too cold there. Guides said it would be unreasonable to camp there, that it would be too difficult to set up the tents and the wind could destroy them, they also predicted everyone would stay inside the tents all the time to avoid the freezing cold.

With Colera out of the plan, our idea was to attack the summit from Nido, at 5500m. We would leave Nido at 4am on route to the summit, planning to arrive at 2pm at the latest. If, at any point, we were behind schedule, the guides would tell us to turn back. You cannot arrive at the summit too late because then it becomes too risky and you might not return in time. In fact, during our expediction, we got news of one American guy, 30 years old, who decided to keep going on his summit attempt against his guide's advice. The guide turned back at 6700m and the man kept going up. He summitted at 10pm, an insane time to summit. He managed to get back to his tent but died from exhaustion and hypothermia.

# Summit push

We woke up at 3am to have breakfast in our dome, which barely fit all of us inside. There was plenty of food, tea, water, everything we needed. I was not feeling well and was about to give up here, but I'm not really one to give up easily, specially not while everyone else was hyped up to begin the summit push.

It was dark and extremely cold, -15° C. Stupidly, I got out of my tent with only the inner part of my double boot and light gloves. Because I am lazy. This turned out to be a huge mistake because my feet and hands got super cold super fast. While everyone left their tents fully dressed, wearing everything and with their backpack set up, I left mine unprepared, as if I were going to the beach. 

I ended up having to sit on a random rock on the ground to put on my double boots and prepare my backpack at 3:50am when everyone was getting ready to go. I'm always late. So I put on my double boots, it takes me like 5 minutes because they're annoying to put on, my hands are absolutely freezing, I put on my mittens and get some relief. I'm finally ready and then I realize I lost one of my trekking poles. Nowhere to be found, people are already marching, it's pitch black, no way I can find it.

I start my summit push with my feet and hands already freezing, my head light sucks and is visibly weaker than everyone else's and I am missing one trekking pole. Great.

After about 10 minutes going up from Nido, I think to myself that I have to give up and turn back or my extremities will literally freeze, I'll get a frostbite. As instructed, I yell to the team "STOP" and explain that I want to turn back. The guides check up on me, they see that my jacket isn't properly covering me and my double boots aren't tight enough. The guide literally goes to his knees and fixes my double boots, that was reallyy nice of him. And we continued marching.

Anyway, my feet and hands don't get any warmer after this. I said fuck it, we're here anyway, as long as I can control my fingers and toes I'll keep going.

And we keep going uphill in zigzags for about 3 hours until the sun rises, the view is astonishing but again, we couldn't stop to appreciate the view down there, much less up here at near 6000.

We reach Colera a couple at about 7:30am and here we have our first group of people turning back. A woman had taken blood pressure medication and almost fainted during this ascent, so she and her boyfriend decided to turn back. One guy was not feeling his toes, decided to go back as well. 

One guide goes down with them, we keep going. The sun really bathes you with motivation when you've been walking for 3 hours in pitch black. We keep walking but at this point we're with the pace of a sloth, it's one step, and deep breath, one step, one deep breath.

After another three hours of walk we reach a place called La Travesia, the traverse. At this point the guides agree to turn back because of strong, constant 80km/h winds which prevent us from going any further. Anticlimatic, but it is what it is. The mountain chooses when it wants any visitors, not the opposite.

We turn back and chill a little bit at our tent and then head down to Plaza de Mulas.

Next day, we go from Plaza de Mulas directly to park entrance and take a van to the hotel. Going down is much faster than going up, admittedly. It takes like a third of the time going down from the high camps and about half the time from base camp to the entrance.

One funny thing about going down is, contrary to going up, with each step you feel stronger, as there's more oxygen in the air. You get tired, yes, and your feet get destroyed from walking down at a steep angle, but there's literally more oxygen getting inside your lungs with makes your cells and your muscles happy.
